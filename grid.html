        In Cascading Style Sheets, CSS grid layout or CSS grid creates complex
        responsive web design grid layouts more easily and consistently across
        browsers.[6] Historically, there have been other methods for controlling
        web page layout methods, such as tables, floats, and more recently, CSS
        Flexible Box Layout (flexbox). CSS grid is currently not an official
        standard (it is a W3C Candidate Recommendation) although it has been
        adopted by the recent versions of all current major browsers.[7]
